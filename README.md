# DUCK Use Case Assistant - BSc Honours Project

This is a fork of UMLet extended with functionality to verify the compliance of UML use case diagrams and their consistency with use case scenarios. For full details of the project, please see **Artemiy-Stepanov-H00344722-Year-4-Dissertation.pdf**. My additions to the code can be found in **umlet-standalone**, **umlet-elements** and **umlet-swing** directories.
